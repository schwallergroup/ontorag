What is the limit of this increase for most catalysts? Are single-atom catalysts an exception to this general trend?\n", "**Definition of Dispersion**\n================================\n\nThe dispersion of nanoparticles in a catalyst is defined as the fraction of surface atoms that are exposed and available for catalytic reactions. It is an important factor in determining the catalytic activity of a material, as it affects the availability of active sites for chemical reactions.\n\n**Increase in Dispersion with Decreasing Particle Size**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe dispersion of nanoparticles increases with decreasing particle size because smaller particles have a larger surface-to-volume ratio, which means that a greater proportion of their atoms are exposed on the surface. This increases the number of active sites available for catalytic reactions. As the particle size decreases, the surface area per unit volume increases, allowing more atoms to be exposed and participate in chemical reactions.\n\n**Limit of Increase in Dispersion**\n------------------------------------\n\nThe limit of this increase in dispersion for most catalysts is typically reached when the particle size approaches the nanoscale, around 1-10 nm. At this point, the particles become so small that they begin to exhibit quantum effects, and their properties can change significantly. For most catalysts, the limit of this increase is typically around 1-2 nanometers in diameter, below which the particles may become too small to be stable or may start to exhibit quantum size effects that alter their catalytic properties.\n\n**Single-Atom Catalysts: An Exception to the General Trend**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nSingle-atom catalysts are an exception to this general trend. In these catalysts, the active sites are individual atoms that are dispersed on a support material, rather than nanoparticles. This allows for nearly 100% dispersion and maximum exposure of active sites. Single-atom catalysts have been shown to exhibit high catalytic activity and selectivity, making them a promising area of research.\n\nIn summary, the dispersion of nanoparticles in a catalyst increases with decreasing particle size due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of smaller particles.
