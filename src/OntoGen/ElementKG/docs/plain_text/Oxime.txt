In organic chemistry, an oxime is an organic compound belonging to the imines, with the general formula RR'C=N-OH, where R is an organic side-chain and R' may be hydrogen, forming an aldoxime, or another organic group, forming a ketoxime. O-substituted oximes form a closely related family of compounds. Amidoximes are oximes of amides (R1C(=O)NR2R3) with general structure R1C(=NOH)NR2R3.
Oximes are usually generated by the reaction of hydroxylamine with aldehydes (R-CH=O) or ketones (RR'C=O). The term oxime dates back to the 19th century, a combination of the words oxygen and imine.
