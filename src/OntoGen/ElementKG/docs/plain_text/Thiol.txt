In organic chemistry, a thiol (; from Ancient Greek  theion (theion) 'sulfur'), or thiol derivative, is any organosulfur compound of the form R-SH, where R represents an alkyl or other organic substituent. The -SH functional group itself is referred to as either a thiol group or a sulfhydryl group, or a sulfanyl group. Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl (-OH) group of an alcohol), and the word is a blend of "thio-" with "alcohol".
Many thiols have strong odors resembling that of garlic or rotten eggs. Thiols are used as odorants to assist in the detection of natural gas (which in pure form is odorless), and the "smell of natural gas" is due to the smell of the thiol used as the odorant. Thiols are sometimes referred to as mercaptans () or mercapto compounds, a term introduced in 1832 by William Christopher Zeise and is derived from the Latin mercurio captans ('capturing mercury') because the thiolate group (RS-) bonds very strongly with mercury compounds.
