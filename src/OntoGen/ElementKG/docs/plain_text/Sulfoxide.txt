In organic chemistry, a sulfoxide, also called a sulphoxide, is an organosulfur compound containing a sulfinyl (>SO) functional group attached to two carbon atoms. It is a polar functional group.  Sulfoxides are oxidized derivatives of sulfides. Examples of important sulfoxides are alliin, a precursor to the compound that gives freshly crushed garlic its aroma, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a common solvent.
