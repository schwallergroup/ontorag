In organic chemistry, a functional group is a substituent or moiety in a molecule that determines the molecule's characteristic chemical reactions. The same functional group typically undergoes similar reactions, regardless of the rest of the molecule's structure. This predictability allows for the systematic design of chemical synthesis and reaction prediction. The reactivity of a functional group can be influenced by nearby groups, and functional group interconversion is key in planning organic synthesis.

Functional groups are groups of atoms in a molecule with specific chemical properties. They are linked to the rest of the molecule by covalent bonds. In polymers, functional groups can add chemical character to nonpolar carbon chains. Some functional groups are charged, such as carboxylate salts, turning the molecule into a polyatomic ion or coordination complex. In coordination chemistry, functional groups that bind to a central atom are called ligands. Functional groups also play a role in solubility; for example, sugar dissolves in water because both share hydroxyl groups that interact well with each other.

Functional groups impact the nomenclature of organic compounds. Traditional naming involves alpha, beta, gamma, etc., while IUPAC conventions use numeric labels, such as 4-aminobutanoic acid. Functional groups contribute to the classification of molecules, and the naming system combines group names with parent alkane names to create systematic names. While "moiety" overlaps with "functional group," a moiety can refer to larger units containing multiple functional groups, like an aryl moiety.

#### Names of Radicals or Moieties

These names are used to refer to the moieties themselves or to radical species, and also to form the names of halides and substituents in larger molecules.

When the parent hydrocarbon is unsaturated, the suffix ("-yl", "-ylidene", or "-ylidyne") replaces "-ane" (e.g., "ethane" becomes "ethyl"); otherwise, the suffix replaces only the final "-e" (e.g., "ethyne" becomes "ethynyl").

When used to refer to moieties, multiple single bonds differ from a single multiple bond. For example, a methylene bridge (methanediyl) has two single bonds, whereas a methylidene group (methylidene) has one double bond. Suffixes can be combined, as in methylidyne (triple bond) vs. methylylidene (single bond and double bond) vs. methanetriyl (three double bonds).

There are some retained names, such as methylene for methanediyl, 1,x-phenylene for phenyl-1,x-diyl (where x is 2, 3, or 4), carbyne for methylidyne, and trityl for triphenylmethyl.

Classes of compounds by bond type and radicals are:

    Single Bond
    Double Bond
    Triple Bond
    Carboxylic Acyl Radical

Subclass relationships:

    Single Bond has a radical form represented by R*, with the suffix -yl, as in the Methyl Group or Methyl Radical.
    Double Bond has a radical form represented by R:, with the suffix -ylidene, as in Methylidene.
    Triple Bond has a radical form represented by R, with the suffix -ylidyne, as in Methylidyne.
    Acyl is a subclass of Carboxylic Acyl Radical, represented by R-C(=O)*, with the suffix -oyl, as in Acetyl.
