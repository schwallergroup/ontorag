In organic chemistry, nitroso refers to a functional group in which the nitric oxide (-N=O) group is attached to an organic moiety. As such, various nitroso groups can be categorized as C-nitroso compounds (e.g., nitrosoalkanes; R-N=O), S-nitroso compounds (nitrosothiols; RS-N=O), N-nitroso compounds (e.g., nitrosamines, RN(-R')-N=O), and O-nitroso compounds (alkyl nitrites; RO-N=O).
