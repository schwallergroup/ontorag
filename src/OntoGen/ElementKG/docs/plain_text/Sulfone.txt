In organic chemistry, a sulfone is a organosulfur compound containing a sulfonyl (R-S(=O)2-R') functional group attached to two carbon atoms. The central hexavalent sulfur atom is double-bonded to each of two oxygen atoms and has a single bond to each of two carbon atoms, usually in two separate hydrocarbon substituents.
