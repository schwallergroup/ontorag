In organic chemistry, an amide, also known as an organic amide or a carboxamide, is a compound with the general formula R-C(=O)-NR'R'', where R, R', and R'' represent any group, typically organyl groups or hydrogen atoms. The amide group is called a peptide bond when it is part of the main chain of a protein, and an isopeptide bond when it occurs in a side chain, as in asparagine and glutamine. It can be viewed as a derivative of a carboxylic acid (R-C(=O)-OH) with the hydroxyl group (-OH) replaced by an amine group (-NR'R''); or, equivalently, an acyl (alkanoyl) group (R-C(=O)-) joined to an amine group.
Common of amides are formamide (H-C(=O)-NH2), acetamide (H3C-C(=O)-NH2), benzamide (C6H5-C(=O)-NH2), and dimethylformamide (H-C(=O)-N(-CH3)2). Some uncommon examples of amides are N-chloroacetamide (H3C-C(=O)-NH-Cl) and chloroformamide (Cl-C(=O)-NH2).
Amides are qualified as primary, secondary, and tertiary according to whether the amine subgroup has the form -NH2, -NHR, or -NRR', where R and R' are groups other than hydrogen.
