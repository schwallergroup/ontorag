In organic chemistry, thioketones (from Ancient Greek  theion (theion) 'sulfur'; also known as thiones or thiocarbonyls) are organosulfur compounds related to conventional ketones in which the oxygen has been replaced by a sulfur. Instead of a structure of R2C=O, thioketones have the structure R2C=S, which is reflected by the prefix "thio-" in the name of the functional group. Thus the simplest thioketone is thioacetone, the sulfur analog of acetone. Unhindered alkylthioketones typically tend to form polymers or rings.
