In organic chemistry, isocyanate is the functional group with the formula R-N=C=O. Organic compounds that contain an isocyanate group are referred to as isocyanates.  An organic compound with two isocyanate groups is known as a diisocyanate. Diisocyanates are manufactured for the production of polyurethanes, a class of polymers.
Isocyanates should not be confused with cyanate esters and isocyanides, very different families of compounds.  The cyanate (cyanate ester) functional group (R-O-CN) is arranged differently from the isocyanate group (R-N=C=O). Isocyanides have the connectivity R-NC, lacking the oxygen of the cyanate groups.
