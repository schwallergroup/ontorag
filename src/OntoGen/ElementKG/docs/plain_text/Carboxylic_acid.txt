In organic chemistry, a carboxylic acid is an organic acid that contains a carboxyl group (-C(=O)-OH) attached to an R-group. The general formula of a carboxylic acid is often written as R-COOH or R-CO2H, sometimes as R-C(O)OH with R referring to an organyl group (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, aryl), or hydrogen, or other groups. Carboxylic acids occur widely. Important examples include the amino acids and fatty acids. Deprotonation of a carboxylic acid gives a carboxylate anion.
