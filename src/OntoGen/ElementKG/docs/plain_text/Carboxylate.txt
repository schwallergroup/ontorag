In organic chemistry, a carboxylate is the conjugate base of a carboxylic acid, RCOO- (or RCO-2). It is an  anion, an ion with negative charge.
Carboxylate salts are salts that have the general formula M(RCOO)n, where M is a metal and n is 1, 2,.... Carboxylate esters have the general formula RCOOR' (also written as RCO2R'), where R and R' are organic groups.
